Just a repo with some useful CM utils.  The current main thing is to fetch all of the MapReduce Config files for each cluster and merge into one single XML per cluster.


In order to build just do mvn clean install. You will want to use the -DskipTests for now unless you change the test cases to point a cluster that you have access to.

In order to run it is just:

java -jar CMConfigFileUtils-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar cmHostName userName password


You can also download a given version of client jars doing the following:

java -cp target/CMConfigFileUtils-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.cloudera.manager.utils.DependencyDownloader /tmp/ 4.4.0

C5 

java -cp target/CMConfigFileUtils-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.cloudera.manager.utils.DependencyDownloader /tmp/ 5.0.0
