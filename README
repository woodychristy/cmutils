Just a repo with some useful CM utils.  The current main thing is to fetch the MapReduce Config files from the cluster and merge into one single XML.


In order to build just do mvn clean install.

In order to run it is just:

java -jar CMConfigFileUtils-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar cmHostName userName password
